Juba is a slang word in Hebrew for money. Its origin is in Arabic. Israelis and Arabs have a lot more in common. Juba is the first cryptographic coin with a goal to promote peace and cooperation between Israeliâ€™s and Palestinians. There will ever be ten million Juba, nine million of which will be pre-mined. Anybody with an Israeli or a Palestinian mobile phone number can receive one Juba by sending an opt-in SMS.

The distribution will begin on April 1st, at 12:00 PM GMT+2.

The remaining million coins will be mined by the general public over a period of one year. On April 1st 2015, any remaining unclaimed coins, will be given away to charities focused on promoting peace and cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian people. 50% in Israel, and 50% in Palestinian territories
